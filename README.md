# Tesla Powerwall 2 - Local Gateway API documentation #

## Contributing ##

_(This documentation is currently in flux: portions are updated and portions aren't updated.  Use at your own risk)_

_(If you find issues, please submit pull requests - currently testing on firmware version 20.49.0)_

**Please help me update this: Pull requests are welcome!**

## Overview ##

This is a list of api URLs and some random thoughts I've been able to pull together from the interwebs and other functions we've been able to reverse engineer from the local gateway.  This is not the [ Tesla Owner API] which you can find here: (https://tesla-api.timdorr.com) with a Python library that works nicely to control a Powerwall 2 here: (https://github.com/mlowijs/tesla_api).

A python implementation of the local API can be found here (https://github.com/jrester/tesla_powerwall).

An alternative python implementation available as a pip and tested on firmware version 20.49.0 can be found here (https://pypi.org/project/powerwallstats/).

## Getting Started ##

### A note about HTTPS and SSL Certificates ###

In a recent update to the Powerwall firmware (v1.20+) non-SSL requests (http) are no longer supported and queries will return HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently.  Unfortunately the certificate presented by the Powerwall is not signed by a root certificate authority as they are self-signed.  This results in web browsers and tools like curl not accept it without it either being included as a trusted certificate or a specific action by the user to override the error. 

You have three ways around a certificate error:

1) In web browser this will manifest itself as an error that the certificate is not trusted.  To bypass simply click "details" (IE/Edge) or "Advanced..." (Firefox) and select continue.

2) With curl the `--insecure` or `-k` option will ignore the SSL certificate.  This is ok, but it doesn't authenticate the device you are connecting to.

3) A better way is to export the Powerwall public certificate and add it to the local machine's trusted certificate list or just use the certificate in your curl request.

__I recommend option 3 above.__

_Here's what worked for me:_

Step 1: DNS

Enable DNS lookups, on your local network, for one of the following DNS names in the certificate under the "Certificate Subject Alt Name".  On my gateway these names are:
1) teg
2) powerwall
3) powerpack

You can add this to your local DNS server as an A Record or /etc/hosts file or other DNS name resolution service.  

For /etc/hosts add an entry that looks like this if your Powerwall gateway's IP was 192.168.99.99:

`192.168.99.99	powerwall`

Step 2: Get the certificate
`echo quit | openssl s_client -showcerts -servername powerwall -connect powerwall:443 > cacert.pem`

This grabs the certificate from the powerwall using the DNS entry you setup in step 1.

Step 3: use the certificate in your curl statements
e.g. `curl --cacert cacert.pem https://powerwall/api/meters/aggregates`

If you get this error: `curl: (51) SSL: no alternative certificate subject name matches target host name` then the name you chose (teg or powerwall or powerpack) doesn't match what's in the certificate file and you'll need to check the certificate and perhaps do some googling to figure out the solution.

For the rest of the documentation, I will assume you copied the certificate and are using method C with the Powerwall's public certificate.  If you didn't, just leave out the certificate `--cacert cacert.pem` portion and add `-k`.


Powerwall 2 Web UI

The web UI provides ~~an instantaneous~~ a 250-500ms average(?) power flow diagram an access to the wizard.
Hit your local gateway IP with a browser, i.e. _https://powerwall/

You should see something like this:

)

This returns the current readings from the meters that measure solar, grid, battery, and home production and usage.  Watts, Hz, etc.  Watt values can be positive or negative.  
1. "site" corresponds to "Grid" in the Tesla mobile app
	-Positive numbers indicate power draw from the grid to the system
	-Negative numbers indicate sending power from the system to the grid
2. "battery" corresponds to "Powerwall" in the Tesla mobile app - this is an aggregate number if you have more than one Powerwall
	-Positive numbers indicate power draw from the batteries to the system
	-Negative numbers indicate sending power from the system to the batteries
3. "load" corresponds to "Home" in the Tesla mobile app
	-Positive numbers indicate power draw from the system to the home
	-Negative numbers should never happen
4. "solar" corresponds to "Solar" in the Tesla mobile app
	-Positive numbers indicate power production from solar to the system
	-Negative numbers indicate sending power from the system to solar - this should never be higher than 100 Watts.  On occasion I see +/- -10 at night.
5. "busway" - Unknown - my numbers show 0 for this.
6. "frequency" - Unknown - my numbers show 0 for this.
7. "generator" - Unknown I don't have a generator - my numbers show 0 for this.

#### _GET /api/system/update/status_ ####
_UPDATE: You need to be authenticated for this command_

From: @kylerove:
"After digging, the answer was right on Tesla's website:
https://www.tesla.com/support/energy/powerwall/own/monitoring-from-home-network

username=customer
email=your Tesla account email address
password=last 5 digits of your gateway serial number

You can then reset/choose your own customer password, if you want to make it stronger."

request: `curl --cacert cacert.pem https://powerwall/api/system/update/status`

response: `{"state":"/update_failed","info":{"status":["nonactionable"]},"current_time":1422697552910}`

1. update_failed / status nonactionable = I tried to do an upgrade but I have the latest firmware version already installed.
2. current_time in EPOC.
	-1422697552910 = **GMT**: Monday, April 2, 2018 8:09:17.447 PM
	
	  
possible values of "state" property, according to the code:

-   "/clear_update_status", // Checking for firmware update is in progress (need to keep sending request until state is changed)  
    
-   "/update_succeeded", // Success  
    
-   "/update_failed", // Update failed, or not required  
    
-   "/update_staged", // Staging update?  
    
-   "/download",  // Downloading update  
    
-   "/update_downloaded", // Ready to update  
    
-   "/update_unknown"  

possible values of "status" property according to the code:

-   "ignoring", // possibly some uninterruptable action is in progress?  
    
-   "error",  
    
-   "nonactionable" // everything is OK  
    

  

Use case:  One user is making this request to check new firmware available, and run the upgrade, approximately 30 minutes before switching to discharging (self_consumption mode with 5% reserve). Assumption is - we better upgrade firmware while battery is in standby mode, rather then letting gateway upgrade itself later, because it will stop battery possibly during peak hours for an upgrade. He noticed his gateway has self-upgraded during peak hours, resulting around 15 minutes stop of battery, which was an unpleasant surprise and extra cost. So, his idea was to force a new firmware check (and upgrade) when battery is not used:

  
-   7:15am  check for new fimware and run an upgrade if firmware is available  
    
-   7:55am  - start discharging (self_consumption, 5% reserve)  
    
-   10:05pm  - start charging (backup, 100% reserve)  
    

Southern California Edison has TOU plan with the following details:

-   8am-2pm,  8pm-10pm  - offpeak  
    
-   2pm-8pm  - peak  
    
-   10pm-8am  - super offpeak

___
Note: __*** The below API calls require authentication ***__

Note2: __*** This documentation is old (created on version 1.15) and needs updating ***__
__*** I wouldn't be surprised if less than 1% of the below still works in versions 1.40+ ***__


**Login**
#### _POST /api/login/Basic_ ####

Note: _This section needs updating: Does this work?_

**Authentication example:**
Note: Getting an authentication token will stop the powerwall.  It won't charge, discharge, or collect stats on v1.15+.  Therefore you should re-enable the powerwall after getting a token.  
See: the _/api/sitemaster/run_ section above.

Here is an example login using a blank username (none needed) and a serial number of T123456789.  The password is S+Serial number: ST123456789.

Request: 

`curl --cacert cacert.pem -s -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"","password":"ST123456789","force_sm_off":false}' https://powerwall/api/login/Basic`

Response: 

`{"email":null,"firstname":"Tesla","lastname":"Energy","roles":["Provider_Engineer"],"token":"OgiGHjoNvwx17SRIaYFIOWPJSaKBYwmMGc5K4tTz57EziltPYsdtjU_DJ08tJqaWbWjTuI3fa_8QW32ED5zg1A==","provider":"Basic"}`

Save the token for use with the below calls.

**Note for Windows users:**
Windows shell handles quotes differently than linux Bash.
In windows, the above example works by:
1. changing the single quotes to double quotes
2. escape the double quotes inside the -d section

Windows Example Request: 

`curl -s -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"username\":\"\",\"password\":\"ST123456789\",\"force_sm_off\":false}" https://192.168.xxx.xxx/api/login/Basic`

#### _/api/operation_ ####
Change the Powerwall mode and Reserve Percentage

_Note 1: Making changes to the Powerwalls via the Mobile application can take some time to go into effect.  There's a rumor that states that the changes happen around 30 minutes past the hour. (Probably based on a cron job in Tesla's servers)._

_Note 2: Setting a value is not sufficient to make the change.  You must "save" or "commit" the configuration to have it go into effect.  See  the _Config Completed_ section below._

_Note 3: Once a value is changed and committed it is immediately in effect._


#### _GET /api/operation_ ####

request: `curl --header "Authorization: Bearer OgiGHjoNvwx17SRIaYFIOWPJSaKBYwmMGc5K4tTz57EziltPYsdtjU_DJ08tJqaWbWjTuI3fa_8QW32ED5zg1A==" https://192.168.xxx.xxx/api/operation`

response: `{"mode":"self_consumption","backup_reserve_percent":15}`


#### _POST /api/operation_ ####

The below request would set the battery mode to "Self-powered" and a "Reserve for Power Outages" to 20% (app value) using the token retrieved from the authentication example. 

request: `curl --header "Authorization: Bearer OgiGHjoNvwx17SRIaYFIOWPJSaKBYwmMGc5K4tTz57EziltPYsdtjU_DJ08tJqaWbWjTuI3fa_8QW32ED5zg1A==" -X POST -d '{"mode":"self_consumption","backup_reserve_percent":24.6}' https://192.168.xxx.xxx/api/operation`

response: `{"mode":"self_consumption","backup_reserve_percent":24.6}`

Valid Modes:
1. `self_consumption`
2. `backup`
3. `autonomous` (aka Time of Use (TOU) as reported by dlieu on the teslamotorsclub.com forums)
4. `scheduler`  aka Aggregation - This seems like it is not supported now. 

The JavaScript constant in the code of mobile client for Android has the following options:

```
OperationModes = 
{SELF_CONSUMPTION: "self_consumption",
TIME_OF_USE: "autonomous",
BACKUP: "backup",
AGGREGATION: "scheduler"}
```

There also is an option to set the max PV Export power in kW.  I'm not 100% sure what that does but I could guess (Time of use?). Mine is currently set to null (probably because time of use isn't enabled on my system yet (as of April 2018).  You can omit this key/value pair from the POST.

`{max_pv_export_power_kW: null, mode: "self_consumption", backup_reserve_percent: 24}`

Note the difference in the app value (20%) versus the value we set via the local API (24%).  The difference is likely proportional until you reach 100%:

___**Tested values:**___

| APP Setting | API Setting |
| :-------------: |:-------------:|
| 5%	| 10%		| 
| 16%	| 20%		|
| 16%	| 20.6%		|
| 20%	| 24%		|
| 21%	| 24.6% 	|
| 30%	| 33%		|
